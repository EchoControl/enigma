This is mostly chameleoning of following [skin](https://www.deviantart.com/fuckyeahlucas/art/Spotify-Control-WORKING-Rainmeter-Skin-v4-3-594025385)

I'm sorry for straight copypasting it.

**The following steps are MANDATORY for a working skin, unfortunately. Read all the instructions first, please!**

0. Delete any old version of the old "Spicetify Rainmeter Skin" if you used this skin before.
1. Follow these instruction carefully (5 commands one after an other into PowerShell + Comprehensive Guide available): pastebin.com/87muQXZ2
1.1 If an error occurs at the beginning you need to enable Internet Explorer 11 within the Windows settings and start it once for a properly working PowerShell.
1.2 If an error occurs saying something about a backup, just delete "backup" from the last line "spicetify backup apply" --> "spicetify apply" and press ENTER again
1.3 If an error occurs at the end simply reinstall Spotify as suggested by the script.
2. Install Spotify Control Rainmeter skin.
3. Play a song in Spotify and benefit.
4. After every Spotify client update you need to re-do step #1 (entering all 5 PowerShell commands again)
